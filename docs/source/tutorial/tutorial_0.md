title: Introduction

Welcome to the iOS tutorial for working with Apollo! This tutorial was prepared with the following tools: 

- Xcode 11.2
- Swift 5.1
- Apollo 0.19.0

This tutorial assumes you already have Xcode installed, and that you are working on a Mac (since as of this writing, that's the only place to run Xcode). 

This tutorial also assumes at least some prior iOS development knowledge. If there's anything that's unclear or not working, please feel free to ask questions by either [opening an issue on our GitHub repo](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-ios/issues) or [stopping by our Spectrum Chat for help](https://spectrum.chat/apollo/apollo-ios).

## What are you building?

This tutorial will take you through the steps to add an iOS client from scratch to the result of [Apollo's full stack tutorial](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/tutorial/introduction/). You don't actually have to complete that tutorial to do this one, though - a pre-built version of it will be provided. 

The project allows you to "book a seat" on any of the rockets which have been sent into space by [SpaceX](https://www.spacex.com/), and you'll work through different scenarios and build different types of screens to take advantage of the following Apollo tools:

- Schema Downloading
- Code Generation
- Error Handling
- Queries and Mutations
- Query watching
- Subscriptions
- Uploading
